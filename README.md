RecipeSuggestor
===============

Android App(under development)
RecipeSuggestor lets you store recipes locally. In just a few steps you enter the recipe's name, ingredients, spices 
and description how the recipe is cooked. When you are wondering what to cook (and that day will come), 
you can enter what products you have available and the app will suggest you a list of recipes based on them.
